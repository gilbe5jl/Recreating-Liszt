# Recreating-Liszt

Recreating Liszt is a project aimed at creating music that is of similar composition to the late, great, Franz Liszt using machine learning. The project has two parts, a web-application and a Jupyter notebook application. The web-app is primarily used for documentation purposes, but there is much more functionality planned in the future. The web-app was created using Python (Django), HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, whereas the machine-learning portion was created using Google Magenta.
