# Google Magenta - Generating new music 

What is Magenta?
An open source research project exploring the role of machine learning as a tool in the creative process.
Using Google collab, Python and Magenta we were able to generate new music using midi files. 

This project is aimed at creating music that is of similar composition to the late, great, Franz Liszt using machine learning. The project has two parts, a web-application and a Google Collab portion. The web-app is primarily used for documentation purposes, but there is much more functionality planned in the future. The web-app was created using Python (Django), HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, whereas the machine-learning portion was created using Google Magenta and Collab.
